##Agenda
1. Why and when would we use AngularJS, and when not?
  *  Single-Page-Apps - YES
    1. Consumerization of the Enterprise (people don't want to spend all day working on crappy applications)
    2. Push work-load out
  * Javascript-heavy apps - YES - the biggest hurdle in building large apps in js is structure
    1. No native module system (yet)
    2. No native observables (yet)
    3. Treated like a "toy" language (don't)
  * Line of business apps - YES
  * Heavy animation - Reconsider OR encapsulate animations in modules
    1. Example 1 - [Three.js Periodic Table](http://mrdoob.github.io/three.js/examples/css3d_periodictable.html)
  * Embedded inside another platform (ex. Dynamics CRM forms) - RECONSIDER
    1. Can it be done?  Yes, but these options are better if available...
    2. Host regular static site in virtual sub-directory
    3. Host static site on another server/runtime platform
      * For #2 & #3 use platform sdk, service endpoints, etc.
    4. Keep SPA-like behavior to a minimum and design around traditional post-back behavior
    5. Use something else :)
2. Basic angular concepts of routing, controllers, services and directives
3. General design considerations
4. Hands-On Lab

##Detailed Agenda

This would be my mostly comprehensive list of angular topics, in the order I would present them and also in order of importance (imo):

####Essential
1. Brief background
   * jQuery -> Backbone -> Angular
   * Data-binding
   * IE Support
2. Project Structure - Angular seed vs. recent recommended best practice
3. Module definition
   * Dependency injection
   * Main module
4. Controllers
   * $scope
   * $rootScope
   * nested controllers
5. Views
6. Routing
   * OOTB router
   * angular-ui router
7. Services
8. $watch

####Core, but not quite essential
1. $http & promises
2. $http interceptors
3. Filters
4. Custom Directives
5. $broadcast/$emit/$on
6. Libraries
   * Angular-UI
   * Angular-bootstrapâ€‹


####Ancillary
1. Tooling
   * nodejs/npm
   * bower
   * grunt
   * yoeman
   * chrome plugin
2. Testing
   * Karma
   * Protractor
